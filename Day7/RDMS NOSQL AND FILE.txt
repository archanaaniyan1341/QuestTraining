For when to use a RDBMS, here are some points to consider:
You have relational data, i.e. you have a customer who purchases your products and those products have a supplier and manufacturer
You have large amounts of data and you need to be able to locate relevant information quickly
You need to start worrying about the previous issues identified: scalability, reliability, ACID compliance
You need to use reporting or intelligence tools to work out business problems

As for when to use a NoSQL
You have lots of data that needs to be stored which is unstructured
Scalability and speed needs
You generally don't need to define your schema up front, so if you have changing requirements this might be a good point

Finally, when to use files
You have unstructured data in reasonable amounts that the file system can handle
You don't care about structure, relationships
You don't care about scalability or reliability (although these can be done, depending on the file system)
You don't want or can't deal with the overhead a database will add
You are dealing with structured binary data that belongs in the file system, for example: images, PDFs, documents, etc.
